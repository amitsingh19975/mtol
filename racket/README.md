### Issues
Had issues installing racket-mode the first time, but seemed to be a transient issue with refreshing packages from melpa.

Despite the docs having a more modern UI and nice hyperlinking, I found the documentation to be a little difficult to use. Perhaps, this was due to not understanding some basics around struct behavior (such as what I assume are macro-generated accessors). I also missed the one page guides, manuals, and documentation available for Common Lisp.
