# C++

[Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp)

## Dev Env

Emacs already has `c++-mode` by default so nothing to install there.

### Compiler

### LSP
[ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls) - Cumbersome build process
[clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/) - Just `brew install llvm` and you're ready

### Issues
* `clang` didn't work to compile `snippets/fizzbuzz.cpp` and maybe that's a me problem. `clang++` works fine and so does `g++`.
